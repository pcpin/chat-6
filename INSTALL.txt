 Before you begin
--------------------

     1.	Backup your database and files!
	If something goes wrong, you will be able to roll-back to previous installation
	without data loss.

 Upgrade instructions
------------------------

1. Upgrading from PCPIN Chat 5.xx

  If you have PCPIN Chat 5.xx installed on your server and you want to import
  existing users, settings and other data into the new version, follow these steps:

   1.1.	Delete existing chat files and directories, *EXCEPTING* /images directory.
	The directory /images contains user avatars, smilies and room background images
	which will be required during upgrade.

   1.5.	Make the file /config/db.inc.php writeable for the web server (CHMOD 666 is a good choice).
	The installation script will try to store database connection data into that file.
	If you can't or don't want to make this file writeable, then you must edit it manually before
	you start the installation.

   1.6.	Now you are ready to start the installation. Point your brouser to /install.php

 Troubleshooting: Short FAQ
------------------------------

 Q: Why does install.php shows only a white screen?
 A: Your browser does not supports JavaScript. Enable JavaScript support in your browser.

 Q: I see the GD library WARNING "Some image features will be not available".
    What does it means? Can PCPIN Chat be installed onto my server?
 A: PCPIN Chat can be installed onto your server.
    GD is a PHP extension used for image manipulation. PCPIN Chat uses it for image
    thumbnails creation. If this library is not installed, then no image thumbnails
    will be available.

 Q: I see the Multibyte support WARNING. What does it means? Can PCPIN Chat be
    installed onto my server?
 A: PCPIN Chat can be installed onto your server.
    mbstring is a PHP extension used for multibyte charset manipulations. PCPIN Chat
    is multilingual and uses UTF8 encoding. If there are no mbstring features available,
    then PCPIN Chat will use standard PHP ISO mechanisms which is slower and may cause
    incorrect charset conversions.

 Q: Installation script asks me to enter database connection data. Where can i found it?
 A: Ask your hosting provider or server administrator.

 Q: What is "Name prefix for all tables used by chat"?
 A: In order to avoid conflicts with any other software that uses the same database as
    PCPIN Chat, all database tables in PCPIN Chat may have the name prefix. You don't need
    to change the proposed value.

 Q: Do I need to set any write permissions on files or directories used by PCPIN Chat?
 A: No. PCPIN Chat stores all data into the database.
